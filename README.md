# Is Not Odd Even (TypeScript)

I have observed [Is Odd Even TS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-not-odd-even-ts) and I have found it lacking. For this reason, Is Not Odd Even (Typescript) must exist.

## Installation

`npm i https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-not-odd-even-ts`

## Usage

```js
const INOETS = require("is-not-odd-even-ts"); // JS
const INOETS = require("is-not-odd-even-ts"); // TS

INOETS.
```
